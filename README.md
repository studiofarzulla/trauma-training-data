# Trauma as Bad Training Data: A Computational Framework for Developmental Psychology

**Author:** Murad Farzulla

## Abstract

This essay proposes a computational framework for understanding childhood developmental trauma by reframing it as "bad training data" in a learning system. Drawing parallels between machine learning training problems and developmental psychology, it offers a mechanistic account that removes moral judgment while preserving insight into how adverse childhood experiences shape adult behavior and cognition.

## Key Framework

The essay categorizes developmental trauma through four ML training data problems:

1. **Direct Negative Data**: Abuse as actively harmful training signals
2. **Indirect Negative Data**: Witnessing trauma, absorbing environmental stress
3. **Absent Positive Data**: Neglect as missing crucial training examples
4. **Limited Data Diversity**: Restricted exposure (nuclear family isolation)

## Key Contributions

1. **Novel Typology**: Four-category classification of developmental trauma via training data quality
2. **Mechanistic Clarity**: Explains "why" trauma persists without moral blame
3. **Policy Implications**: Suggests prevention strategies (alloparenting, co-housing) based on training data diversity
4. **Interdisciplinary Integration**: Bridges ML, neuroscience, attachment theory, developmental psychology

## Current Status

This is a **work in progress**. The essay has undergone peer review and received a rating of **8/10 for academic rigor**. Areas for improvement identified:

- Clearer distinction between analogy and mechanism throughout
- Earlier integration of gene-environment interaction research
- More empirical operationalization of key concepts
- Stronger evidence for nuclear family critiques
- Resolution of cultural universality claims

## Testable Predictions

The framework generates several empirical predictions (Section 6.1):

1. Intervention timing effects mirror retraining vs training from scratch
2. Caregiver diversity correlates with outcome resilience
3. ML analogs can model developmental trajectories
4. Prevention vs intervention cost asymmetries
